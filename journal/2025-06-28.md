### OSCP Bible

**Chapter 8 – Web Attacks & BurpSuite**

* Focused on BurpSuite usage for intercepting and modifying HTTP traffic
* Covered theoretical XSS and Java-based injection attacks
* Light Gobuster enumeration
* Takeaway: Reinforced the role of interception proxies in web testing and how Java-based payloads behave

### Lab Environment

**Win11 Lab Deployed – Active Directory Simulation**

* VMs deployed:
  - `HYD-DC1` – AD DS, DNS, DHCP, CA
  - `HYD-CM1` – ConfigMgr, WSUS, SQL Server
  - `HYD-CLIENT1–6` – Windows 11 domain-joined and workgroup clients
  - `HYD-GW1` – Lab gateway
* Lab running inside Hyper-V with external switch for internet routing
* Confirmed initial VM boot and basic connectivity

**Next Step:**
* Snapshot baseline for all VMs
* Configure Kali attacker box to interact with lab
* Begin enumeration and AD mapping for Chapter 9

### Hack The Box

**Box aligned with OSCP Chapter 8**

* Followed BurpSuite workflow closely from the chapter
* XSS payload testing and HTTP proxy interception
* Encountered technical hurdle: BurpSuite proxy struggled with bridged VM and VPN combo (intermittent drops)
* Chose to stick with custom Kali setup instead of HTB Pwnbox for deeper troubleshooting practice

### Python MOOC 2025

**Progress: Part 3 – Loops with Conditions**

* Completed the majority of loop exercises with `while` / `for` + conditionals
* Concepts solidified:
  - Loop nesting
  - Flow control inside loops
  - Boolean logic with loop conditions

---

### Key Takeaways

* BurpSuite networking limitations taught more than the web vulnerabilities themselves
* HTB box reinforced proxy use under challenging real-world conditions
* Major milestone: AD Lab now live, paving way for real Windows lateral movement and post-exploitation work
* Python logic skills growing steadily; foundation feeling more natural daily
