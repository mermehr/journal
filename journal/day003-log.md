## Day Log - June 16th, 2025

### Completed Tasks
- Finished **Module 2** of the Cisco *Ethical Hacking* course
- Performed targeted **OSINT research** on a prospective employer's technology stack and leadership activity patterns
- Completed **light Python scripting practice**
- Conducted a high-level **self-assessment** on learning path direction and cognitive load management

### üí° Reflections
Today marked a deliberate shift in direction‚Äîaway from slow-paced tutorials and toward more integrated, hands-on work. After revisiting the 100 Days of Code course, I made the conscious decision to step away from it. While structured, its basic pacing doesn't suit my current level or needs.

In its place, I‚Äôll lean into agile code challenges that pair with real-world red team tasks‚Äîsomething more aligned with how I actually learn. That includes scripting tools for recon, writing exploit helpers, or automating reporting. This approach respects both my technical instincts and neurological bandwidth.

The OSINT work I did today, while valuable, had a slightly invasive feel to it. I set some internal boundaries for future recon work on companies I might be working with‚Äîit‚Äôs important to keep a clean ethical line when mixing research and job prospects.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Touched
- Python scripting (light automation and exploration)
- Recon methodology for OSINT (LinkedIn tracking, temporal activity inference)
- Cisco Ethical Hacking platform (labs + theory)

### üîÑ Decisions & Next Steps
- Drop 100DoC course (not well-matched to skill level)
- Begin integrating **code challenges** with **red team labs** moving forward
- Prioritize **health-conscious scheduling** to avoid cognitive overload and seizure risk
- Prep for **VM breach + Python task** challenge tomorrow (RedMind project)
