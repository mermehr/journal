# Training Summary: June 13 ‚Äì June 24, 2025

## üß† Learning Focus
- **Cisco Ethical Hacker Course**:
  - Completed Modules 2‚Äì4: OSINT, scanning, social engineering, and vulnerability assessment.
  - Applied real-world recon techniques on companies and platforms.
  - Treated overlapping material as review to preserve energy for practical labs.

- **Red Team Foundations**:
  - Multiple VulnHub and HTB-style boxes completed.
  - Practiced enumeration, privilege escalation, and shell stabilization (TTY, socat).
  - Reinforced the value of persistence, logic, and clean workflow organization.
  - Integrated regex into recon scripts to clean output and speed analysis.

- **Platform Decisions**:
  - Dropped lower-value content (e.g., CEH videos, redundant material).
  - Pivoted toward high-yield resources (HTB, lab work, Python automation).

---

## üêç Python Practice
- Completed core MOOC exercises (math logic, functions, regex).
- Built wrappers and tools:
  - Bash/Nmap recon wrappers
  - Regex-based parsers to extract useful data
- Unified dev + journaling workflows into a single Git-based workspace.
- Used scripting to support red team labs and optimize workflow.

---

## üíª Red Team Activities
- Boxes Completed:
  - DC:1 (logic flow preserved despite tooling issues)
  - Escalate My Privileges: 1 (completed and reported)
  - Small HTB boxes including one with MySQL exploitation
- Tools & techniques explored:
  - Shell handling (`python3 -c 'pty.spawn'`)
  - Recon (`enum4linux`, `nikto`)
  - Regex for parsing
  - OSINT targeting

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure & Setup
- Migrated journal + script storage into unified system with autosave and Git
- Built clean sandbox VM environment with stable VPN separation
- Removed unnecessary curriculum (CEH) to reduce noise
- Prioritized sustainable learning to avoid cognitive overload

---

## üîë Key Takeaways
- Focused red team workflow + scripting = best results
- Journaling and self-reflection are helping clarify priorities
- Real-world recon and automation feel more aligned than passive course watching
- Python tools are extending into operational utility (not just academic)
