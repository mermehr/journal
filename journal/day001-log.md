## Daily Journal – June 13th, 2025

### Completed Tasks

 - [x] Setup GIT for logging
 - [x] Checked latest cybersecurity feeds/blogs
 - [x] Completed red team room
 - [x] Cleaned up old C# repo's
 - [x] MITRE, DLP, EDR

### What I Learned

- You're never too old for cybersecurity
- Take a day job - worry about certs later
- Nothing much other than what I've already pulled from blue teaming

### Notes

> Today was a focused and productive day of consolidating and moving
> forward with red team preparation. Took some time to reflect on my
> technical direction and reaffirmed my decision to pivot fully into red
> teaming. After completing the SOC path previously, I feel confident
> enough to dive deeper.
> 
> Made progress on refining the structure of my GitHub workspace to
> better align with my current goals—keeping it clean, relevant, and
> focused on showcasing practical skills that reflect my transition into
> offensive security.
> 
> Also spent time exploring some longer-term career implications of red
> teaming, weighing its challenges and scarcity in job postings. I’m
> confident that despite initial barriers, it’s the right fit
> intellectually and tactically.
> 
> Mental state: Clear and focused. Not overstimulated, but steady.
> Noticed some small but meaningful signs of cognitive sharpening—likely
> linked to the med changes I’ve been tracking.
> 
> Tomorrow, I’ll continue progressing along the red team pathway, get
> back on track with Python, and aim to write or repurpose a few small
> tools that reflect common red team tasks.
