<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

Today was a focused and productive day of consolidating and moving forward with red team preparation. Took some time to reflect on my technical direction and reaffirmed my decision to pivot fully into red teaming. After completing the SOC path previously, I feel confident enough to dive deeper.

Made progress on refining the structure of my GitHub workspace to better align with my current goals—keeping it clean, relevant, and focused on showcasing practical skills that reflect my transition into offensive security.

Also spent time exploring some longer-term career implications of red teaming, weighing its challenges and scarcity in job postings. I’m confident that despite initial barriers, it’s the right fit intellectually and tactically.

Mental state: Clear and focused. Not overstimulated, but steady. Noticed some small but meaningful signs of cognitive sharpening—likely linked to the med changes I’ve been tracking.

Tomorrow, I’ll continue progressing along the red team pathway, get back on track with Python, and aim to write or repurpose a few small tools that reflect common red team tasks.

> _Progress is compounding, even when it doesn’t look loud._
