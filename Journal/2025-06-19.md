### General Status:

Felt mentally sharp and ready to move forward today. Hit a few technical frustrations that reminded me where not to waste my energy. Progress was made across multiple fronts. Stayed focused on real-world relevance, not just solving boxes.

### Reflections

I’m more confident today that what I need is variety, not repetition. Hitting the same type of problem over and over isn't progress—chaining logic across different systems is.

Avoided falling into the "fix the toolchain" trap. I’ve done that already in my life. Today, I was honest with myself about what work is meaningful, and what is just a distraction.

I’m not overreaching. I’m running into obsolete scaffolding that doesn’t fit what I’m building anymore. Knowing that keeps me on track.

DC:1 is functionally complete. The root path was understood even if I didn’t babysit the exploit to finish. The point was made, the skill reinforced, the value extracted.
