## Daily Journal – June 22–23, 2025

### General Status:

Two-day block focused on foundational cleanup, alignment, and reorientation. Cleared through early Python material, skimmed CEH content that overlapped with prior training, and spent time analyzing the evolution and partial disappearance of older hacking scenes. Resetting the mental map and shifting priorities going forward.

### Completed Tasks

Python – MOOC 2025
* Continued from previous day, completed the first section
* Heavy focus on math-based scripting, function logic, and general control flow
* Work was repetitive but helped reestablish fluency in basic Python structure

Cisco Ethical Hacker – Module 4
* Worked through most of the module
* Topics included social engineering tactics and spoofing methods
* Tools touched: SET, BeEF, spoofapp/spoofcard
* Minimal learning gain due to heavy overlap with college training
* Treated as a tactical refresh rather than a deep dive

Scene Research – Legacy Platforms
* Explored HackThisSite, HBH.sh, and similar resources
* Research focus: mapping the shift and decline of pre-2022 hacking spaces
* Clarified current training landscape and affirmed HTB as go-to platform

Hack The Box
* Skipped for now – deferred due to time and shifting focus

### Reflections

This was a mental realignment window. The scene research was oddly valuable — it reminded me of where I came from, what got lost, and where I want to rebuild from. Python scripting is feeling more natural again, even though I’m moving slow on purpose to reinforce memory.

CEH is drifting into redundancy for me, similar to what happened with Security+ content. It’s useful as scaffolding, but not worth full attention. I’ll continue skimming it for strategic reinforcement but keep my depth work elsewhere.

HTB is now my primary lab focus going forward. The legacy platforms still have a place — but more for cultural context and psychological pattern recognition than skill development.
