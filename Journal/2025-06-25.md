## OSCP Bible – Module 6: Manual Enumeration

Module 6 complete.

Lots of detailed notes taken and appended to `notes/enumeration_cheat_sheet.md`. This section focused on manual enumeration techniques—solid reminder of the importance of not just relying on automation. Emphasis was placed on being prepared for situations where you're stuck on a client’s Windows machine without access to your own Kali environment or internet access.

Covered several alternative Windows-native enumeration tools and approaches. Valuable to understand the internals instead of pushing pre-built command sequences without grasping what’s happening under the hood.

Also touched on stealth tactics—leveraging intimate knowledge of common enumeration tools to avoid triggering alarms.

**Tools Highlighted:**

- `nmap`, `nc`, `netcat`, `host`, `dnsrecon`, `dnsenum`, `nslookup`
- PowerShell: `test-netconnection`
- SNMP: `onesixtyone`, `snmpwalk`
- `nbtscan`

## Python MOOC 2025 – Part 2 Progress

Completed Part 2: Sections 1–3.

Topics covered:

- Programming terminology
- Conditions and control structures
- Looping techniques
- Arithmetic operations (introduced to **modulo**, which was new to me)

Also shamelessly stole and modified a Python script for **SMTP enumeration and user verification**—working version helped reinforce practical scripting and parsing logic.

## Hack The Box (HTB) Summary

### Box 1 – FTP Breach

- Performed light enumeration
- Anonymous FTP login
- Retrieved flag

---

### Box 2 – Windows / NTLMv2 / WinRM Chain

- Standard `nmap` and `gobuster` enumeration
- Targeted SMB and captured NTLMv2 hash using **Responder**
- Cracked the hash with **John the Ripper**
- Logged in with **evil-winrm**
- Captured flag

---

### Box 3 – S3 / PHP Reverse Shell

- Used `dig` and `wfuzz` for DNS and web recon
- Found AWS S3 bucket hosting PHP
- Deployed reverse shell using `awscli`
- Caught the shell and gained access

## Notes

Good traction today. Manual enumeration refresher + Python logic building + diverse HTB box challenges.
