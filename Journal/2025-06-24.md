### Completed Tasks

**Organization & Workflow**
- Finalized red team syllabus structure for clarity and focus  
- Migrated journaling system to a more comfortable and sustainable platform for long-term writing

**Security Analysis**
- Practiced document scanning techniques to identify malicious content, Java-based injection points, and suspicious function calls

**Study & Reading**
- Reached page 131 in the OSCP manual  
  - So far, not much new knowledge, but the extra detail is appreciated  
  - Glad I skipped the first 5 chapters to avoid redundancy  
  - Will revisit the documentation module at a later point

**Python Practice**
- Focused on mathematical operations and logic workflows for reinforcement (not logging specific content)

**Networking & Lab Setup**
- Resolved VPN and networking conflicts on HTB lab VM  
- Secured a proper sandbox configuration—isolated HTB activity from host while maintaining full internet access

**HTB Progress**
- Completed a couple of small boxes  
- One box required working with a MySQL server—refreshing, as I hadn’t handled that before in a red team context

### Reflections

System structure and clean mental flow seem more stable today. Streamlining my tools and workspace has already improved my clarity. Now that the foundation is dialed in, the next step is focusing on higher-value targets in HTB and building deeper documentation discipline.
