## Codex Entry – _Before I Knew_

**Date of Original Writing: November 10, 2024**  
**Contextual Note (2025):** This was written before my epilepsy diagnosis. At the time, I had no idea I was experiencing seizure activity. It would take a full generalized seizure months later to finally uncover the neurological cause of my suffering.

----------

Before the seizures had a name.  
Before neurology replaced psychiatry.  
Before I understood the blackouts.

I wrote this to survive. To try and make sense of a cycle I was stuck inside — a cycle no medication touched, no psychiatrist understood. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar, then MDD with alcohol use disorder. But the truth was deeper and darker: I was seizing — quietly, invisibly — and it took my entire life unraveling for someone to finally see it.

What I described here wasn't mood swings. It was **prodromal seizure activity**, likely complex partial or focal seizures followed by postictal confusion and dissociation. The “observer mode,” the “delusional task urgency,” the “blacking out and functioning” — all classic indicators of frontal or temporal lobe epilepsy. But at the time, I thought I was losing my mind.

**The pattern was brutal:**

-   Hypomanic urgency → sleeplessness → paranoia and hallucinations
    
-   Complete detachment from reality while appearing functional
    
-   A blackout phase where alcohol took over — not as a choice, but as a post-seizure coping mechanism
    
-   Complete amnesia, followed by days of emotional and physical collapse
    

I wasn’t drinking to escape — I was drinking to _anchor_. To dull the brain that wouldn’t stop firing. What others saw as addiction was actually self-defense.

Even my perception of self was distorted. I battled body dysmorphia and dissociation. Mirrors felt like confrontations. Cameras were weapons. My mind was at war with my body, my past, and my reflection.

And yet…

Even in this hell, I wrote, tracked, tried to map the chaos. That’s the part that gets me. That in the middle of brain storms and identity collapses, **I was still trying to understand**. That’s the part that proves I wasn’t crazy. I was fighting for my life.

I am _still_ that person — just no longer lost in the dark.

### The Original Entry (unedited):

> One doctor diagnosed me with bipolar disorder; however, my most recent diagnosis is MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) with AUD (Alcohol Use Disorder). I take 400 mg of quetiapine nightly and 500 mg of metformin twice a day for pre-diabetes and weight management. I just recently started taking 50mg of naltrexone as a preventive measure.
> 
> Here’s a brief example of an episode:  
> It starts with my sleep deteriorating and my energy ramping up. I start taking on far more tasks than most people would even consider manageable. While many of these tasks are necessary, at least half could or should be put off until the others are completed. Despite this, my mind convinces me that completing everything at once is essential.
> 
> After a week or two, depression begins to creep in, accompanied by suicidal thoughts, even though I still have plenty of energy. Delusional thinking sets in. I may believe I’m fat or getting fat, even though I’m not. I start thinking people are following me. I hear noises that aren’t there, and I catch glimpses of things out of the corner of my eye that don’t exist.
> 
> This phase includes generalized irritation, anxiety, paranoia, and depressive or negative thoughts. I begin to feel disconnected from the world, like my brain is vibrating at a different frequency than my surroundings. During this week, I remain hyper-focused on my goals, burying all emotions and maintaining extreme focus on tasks and goals that absolutely must be completed. Sometimes, I delude myself into thinking that my medication is holding me back or causing weight gain, and I may stop taking it.
> 
> Once I finally complete all these irrational tasks and get some rest, everything crashes. The buried feelings return like a tidal wave, crashing into my mind so hard that I lose control. At this point, my conscious mind becomes nothing more than an observer. It feels like my brain shuts off, entering full disaster mode, similar to someone so depressed and suicidal that they believe the only escape from the pain is death. But instead of choosing death, my mind reaches for alcohol to cope.
> 
> I can remember watching myself obtain alcohol, but I’m unable to stop it, trapped in a prison my mind has created. I can only observe, no matter how hard I fight against it. Once home, I have one or two beers before blacking out completely. These blackouts can last a week or two, during which I remember absolutely nothing. Occasionally, I’ll recall bits and pieces where I try to regain control, only to be pulled back into the abyss.
> 
> During these blackout periods, I become a completely different person. I don't normally drink, and I have no desire to drink daily. I’m usually a clean, tidy person. However, from my own and my daughter’s observations, and from reading my text messages, I know that during these times I will:  
> • Completely ignore all responsibilities: work, appointments, meeting family, paying bills, managing money, or anything related to life.  
> • Completely ignore personal health and hygiene: I stop showering, stop eating, stop cleaning, trash my house, and stop taking my medications. I have no regard for safety.  
> • Drink beer nonstop and spend all my money, sometimes even giving it away.
> 
> Despite the blackout, I appear cognitively normal. I converse with people coherently, and my text messages are well-structured, though I have no memory of these interactions. This can last up to two weeks, with little to no memory of what happened.
> 
> Then, suddenly, I snap back to reality. Whether there’s alcohol left or not, I have no desire to drink. I wake up surrounded by the chaos I’ve created—the filth, the missed work, and my drained bank account. I can’t remember important details like the day, date, my age, or even the year. Deep depression, anxiety, and shame take over. I’m terrified to check the calendar, my phone, my emails, or my bank account because I remember nothing.
> 
> For two to four days, I stay in bed, violently ill, deeply depressed, suicidal, and suffering from insomnia. Once I feel slightly better, I start trying to piece my life back together. I delete all my text messages without reading them, due to the pain of not remembering. I check for important emails, contact work, and try to resolve any issues. Slowly, I clean my house and attempt to find money for my basic needs, as all my resources have usually been depleted by this point.
> 
> If the insomnia lasts more than four days, I go to the hospital, though I can usually break out of it myself. When sleep returns, I start going back to work with limited hours. The depression and anxiety begin to subside as I start functioning normally and taking my medication again. While I remain somewhat depressed, I’m no longer suicidal. About two weeks after the episode, I often experience panic attacks for a few days.
> 
> Once my life is back on track, I enter a “maintenance mode” where I feel somewhat mentally stable. However, there’s always a creeping sense of PTSD from the episode, which seems to build up each time. I live my life normally until the cycle starts again—sometimes in two weeks, a month, or the longest period, three months. This cycle happens about 8-10 times a year.
> 
> Two years ago, I made the conscious decision to never drink again, which has given me more insight into these episodes over the past couple of years.
> 
> Also, I should note that I struggle with body dysmorphia. I don’t see the same person in myself that others do, and I’m highly self-conscious about my weight and appearance, despite being a healthy weight and being told that I’m somewhat handsome. I also have an irrational fear of mirrors and having my picture taken. I assume these issues are linked somehow.
> 
> Despite everything, I believe I’m smart, talented, and extremely resourceful. I think that’s how I’ve managed to survive this long.
