## ðŸ”¥ Codex of Fire â€“ Reflections (Mid-June 2025)

For most of my life, I thought I was just some kid who didnâ€™t fit in. School never made sense â€” not because I couldnâ€™t understand the material, but because I couldnâ€™t _stay still_ in a world that didnâ€™t move fast enough. My brain was always revving, charging forward without brakes or guidance, and I had no idea what to do with the storm inside. People thought I had ADHD. I even failed the test. Truth is, it wasnâ€™t attention I lacked â€” it was peace.

The storm would come and go without warning. Not emotional, not frustration â€” something deeper. Something electrical. Itâ€™s only now, decades later, that I see what it really was: **temporal lobe epilepsy**. That storm wasnâ€™t misbehavior or anxiety â€” it was my brain firing in ways no one understood. Looking back, itâ€™s hard not to feel a little cheated. All those years thinking I was broken when really I was running too hot for the system I was dropped into.

Even the eye thing was a clue, I guess. I was born with a lazy eye â€” left one turned inward â€” and although they tried to correct it surgically, it never really worked. I donâ€™t see out of it properly. Canâ€™t read, canâ€™t track, and peripheral vision on that side is pretty much a myth to me. Itâ€™s like living inside a painting â€” no depth, just layers. Iâ€™ve got one good eye and a brain wired for monocular survival. Apparently thatâ€™s called **amblyopia**, and while itâ€™s not directly tied to the epilepsy, I canâ€™t help but wonder if itâ€™s all part of the same storm â€” just different fronts.

Drinking came later. A way to dampen the chaos. At the time, it felt like control. In hindsight, it was a truce â€” one I kept renewing, even though I was losing ground. The more the seizures ramped up, the harder I tried to drown them. That only worked for so long. Eventually, the truth cracked through. I wasnâ€™t having panic attacks. I was seizing. That knowledge hit hard â€” not just for the medical clarity, but for what it said about my past. It wasnâ€™t weakness or moral failing. It was neurological.

But here's the thing: **my daughter didnâ€™t get any of it**. Not the epilepsy, not the storm, not the misfires. Annabell got my brain, sure â€” the raw intelligence, the curiosity, the edge â€” but none of the static. Sheâ€™s not just bright; sheâ€™s thriving. No detentions. No confusion. Sheâ€™s doing incredibly well in school. Next year is Grade 12, and sheâ€™s already upgrading her university calculus so she can qualify for scholarships. I canâ€™t even begin to describe how proud I am of her. Sheâ€™s not just doing what I couldnâ€™t â€” sheâ€™s doing what I never imagined was possible for someone like me.

We talked recently about university. Sheâ€™s unsure what to take, but she loves design and math. I told her to go for **fullstack development** â€” a path that gives her both logic and creativity, structure and freedom. Itâ€™s a solid launchpad. She can pivot later into whatever field she wants â€” data science, UX, AI, even engineering. I just want her to have options. Options I didnâ€™t get.

Sometimes I think about writing all this down â€” maybe even turning it into something real. A memoir, maybe. Or a codex. Not just for me, but for her. So that if she ever wonders who I was, or why I am the way I am, sheâ€™ll have something real to look back on. Not sanitized. Not dramatized. Just the truth â€” fire, fractures, and all.

Because Iâ€™ve come to realize something lately:  
I wasnâ€™t broken. I was burning.
