## Personal Philosophy & Approach to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is less about tools and more about mindset. I believe in learning systems from the ground up, breaking them safely, and rebuilding them stronger. My background in electronics and infrastructure grounds my understanding of how things *really* work — not just how they’re supposed to.

I practice cyber defense and offense as two sides of the same blade:  
> “Know the system. Know the exploit. Know the fix.”

This mindset drives my passion for red team research, scripting my own tools, and helping others understand security as both a technical and human challenge. I thrive on self-directed exploration, critical analysis, and sharing knowledge in ways that make it stick.
