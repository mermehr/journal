Goal: Don’t just "pwn root" — practice writing a _playbook_ for each stage: enumeration, access, privesc, cleanup.

### Why “DC: 1”?

-   Still beginner-friendly but more methodical
    
-   Emphasizes:
    
    -   Web enumeration → code execution
        
    -   WordPress recon → reverse shell
        
    -   Privilege escalation via Linux basics
        
-   Strong practice for pivoting from foothold to root
